[ Chapter 34.1, revised 12/22/2005 ] \\nOther nonimmigrant workers are discussed in Chapter 31 (H-classes), Chapter 32 (L-class), and Chapter \\n33 (O-and P -classes). This chapter is a catch -all for the remaining nonimmigrant classes of aliens who are \\nentering the U.S. principally to engage in employment. This chapter includes treaty traders and investors, \\nrepresentatives of the information media, various religious workers and E -3 Specialty Occupation Workers. \\nThese classes are considered collectively wit hin this chapter because, unlike the H, L, O and P classes, they \\ndo not require pre -approval of a petition by USCIS, unless there has been a substa ntial change in the terms \\nor conditions of E status (see 8 CFR 214.2(e)(8) ). Initial application for a visa to enter in any of these \\nclasses may be made at a consular office overseas. For applicants already in the U.S. in another \\nnonimmigrant category, application may be made using Form I- 129 (except for the I class, which is filed \\non Form I -539 ). Among these classes, only the E -1 and E -2 classes, treaty traders and investors, have any \\nsignificant amount of policy guidance in the form of regulations or precedent decisions. The I category has existed for many years. The R category, added in 1990 by Section 209 o f Pub. L. 101 -649 , was created to \\npermit the temporary admission of religious workers as defined in paragraphs (I), (II) or (III) of section \\n101(a)(27)(C)(ii) of the Act. The E -3 category, added in 2005 by section 501 of Division B of Pub. L. \\n109- 13 , was created to permit the temporary admission of nationals of the Commonwealth of Australia \\nwho are entering the U.S. to perform services in a “specialty occupation.” ', metadata={'source': '../data/docs/e.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

When granting \\nan extension of stay to such a technician, or a change of status to that of a treaty trader, the employing firm \\nshall be advised that the action has been taken with the understanding that the employer will utilize U.S. \\ncitizens or permanent resident aliens, as such persons become available to make the repairs or to be trained. When the employing firm has been so notified, the alien's Form I -539 should be annotated to so indicate. \\nIf the alien should subsequently apply for a further extension of stay, the adjudicator shall determine what \\nsteps the firm has taken to train or employ resident U.S. workers to perform the specialty work.

In \\nparticular, pursuant to section 214(i)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, “specialty occupation” \\nmeans an occupation that requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized \\nknowledge, and attainment of a bachelor’s or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a \\nminimum for entry into the occupation.

Specifically, in order to \\nobtain an employment authorization document, the E -3 nonimmigrant dependent spouse mu st file \\nForm I -765, Application for Employment Authorization, and provide evidence that he or she qualifies as \\nan E-3 spouse and that the nonimmigrant principal is in E -3 principal status. Except as noted below with \\nrespect to where to file, requests for work authorization filed by such persons will be processed in a \\nsimilar manner to the requests from spouses of E -1 and E -2 aliens as outlined in the February 22, 2002 \\nmemo entitled “ Guidance on Employment Authorization for E and L Nonimmigrant Spouses, and for Determinations on the \\nRequisite Employment Abroad for L Blanket Petitions.” \\nThe Form I -765 must be submitted to the Service Center with jurisdiction over the dependent spouse’s \\nplace of residence. However, applications for employment authorization concurrently filed with Form I-\\n129 for E -3 principal aliens can only be filed at the Vermont Service Center. \\nNote 3: \\nThere is an annual c ap of 10,500 initial E -3 applications for each fiscal year that applies to principal E -3 \\naliens. This cap applies to all initial E -3 applications made abroad and to all change of status to E -3 \\napplications made through USCIS.

This chapter includes treaty traders and investors, \\nrepresentatives of the information media, various religious workers and E -3 Specialty Occupation Workers. \\nThese classes are considered collectively wit hin this chapter because, unlike the H, L, O and P classes, they \\ndo not require pre -approval of a petition by USCIS, unless there has been a substa ntial change in the terms \\nor conditions of E status (see 8 CFR 214.2(e)(8) ). Initial application for a visa to enter in any of these \\nclasses may be made at a consular office overseas. For applicants already in the U.S. in another \\nnonimmigrant category, application may be made using Form I- 129 (except for the I class, which is filed \\non Form I -539 ). Among these classes, only the E -1 and E -2 classes, treaty traders and investors, have any \\nsignificant amount of policy guidance in the form of regulations or precedent decisions. The I category has existed for many years. The R category, added in 1990 by Section 209 o f Pub. L. 101 -649 , was created to \\npermit the temporary admission of religious workers as defined in paragraphs (I), (II) or (III) of section \\n101(a)(27)(C)(ii) of the Act.

       "  '34.1 Backgr ound. [ Chapter 34.1, revised 12/22/2005 ] \\nOther nonimmigrant workers are discussed in Chapter 31 (H-classes), Chapter 32 (L-class), and Chapter \\n33 (O-and P -classes). This chapter is a catch -all for the remaining nonimmigrant classes of aliens who are \\nentering the U.S. principally to engage in employment. This chapter includes treaty traders and investors, \\nrepresentatives of the information media, various religious workers and E -3 Specialty Occupation Workers. \\nThese classes are considered collectively wit hin this chapter because, unlike the H, L, O and P classes, they \\ndo not require pre -approval of a petition by USCIS, unless there has been a substa ntial change in the terms \\nor conditions of E status (see 8 CFR 214.2(e)(8) ). Initial application for a visa to enter in any of these \\nclasses may be made at a consular office overseas. For applicants already in the U.S. in another \\nnonimmigrant category, application may be made using Form I- 129 (except for the I class, which is filed \\non Form I -539 ). Among these classes, only the E -1 and E -2 classes, treaty traders and investors, have any \\nsignificant amount of policy guidance in the form of regulations or precedent decisions. The I category has existed for many years. The R category, added in 1990 by Section 209 o f Pub. L. 101 -649 , was created to \\npermit the temporary admission of religious workers as defined in paragraphs (I), (II) or (III) of section \\n101(a)(27)(C)(ii) of the Act. The E -3 category, added in 2005 by section 501 of Division B of Pub. L. \\n109- 13 , was created to permit the temporary admission of nationals of the Commonwealth of Australia \\nwho are entering the U.S. to perform services in a “specialty occupation.”',\n",

Such employees must have the same nationality as the principal employer. An E-1 alien may perform servi ces for the parent treaty organization or any of its subsidiaries. \\n(3) Nationality . \\nThe principal employer must be either a person in the U.S. having the nationality of the treaty country (or, \\nif not in the U.S., otherwise entitled to treaty trader status) or an enterprise at least 50% owned by persons \\nin the U.S. of such nationality. The list of treaty countries is contained in the Department of State’s Foreign \\nAffairs Manual , chapter 41.51, Exhibit 1 . The nationality list for treaty traders is different than the list for \\ntreaty investors. \\nNote 1: \\nThe nationality of the spouse or child of a treaty trader is irrelevant to their classification. (See 8 CFR \\n214.2(e)(4) .) \\nNote 2:',\n",
       "  \"The spouse of an E nonimmigrant may apply for work authorization. \\n(b) Application Process . \\nBecause a treaty trader does not require a separate petition, E -1 status may be obtained either directly \\nthrough the Department of State (by applying for a an E -1 visa) or, in the case of an alien already in the \\nU.S., by applying to the appropriate service center (the center having jurisdiction over the business) for a \\nchange of status on Form I -129 , including the E supplement. Supporting documents to be submitted with \\nan E-1 application include documents to establish the nature of the employment and the ownership of the \\nenterprise, as described in paragraph (a), above. \\n(c) Approval . \\nIf, from the evidence submitted, the petition appears approvable, endorse the approval block and issue \\nForm I -797 (through CLAIMS), showing the period of validity and the alien beneficiary's name and \\nclassification. An E -1 application may be approved for a period of up to two years and extended in two-\\nyear increments. \\n(d) Denial . \\nIf the evidence does not clearly estab lish the beneficiary’s eligibility for E -1 status and a request for \\nadditional evidence does not appear warranted, prepare a denial notice setting forth the specific reasons why the application cannot be approved. There is no appeal from a denial of E -1 classification. However, if \\nthe facts of the case are novel, complex or potentially of value as a precedent, the decision of the director \\nmay be certified to the Administrative Appeals Office pursuant to 8 CFR 103.4 . \\n(e) Advisory Letters . \\nAn E-1 may seek advice from USCIS concerning any change in employment (e.g capacity of employment, \\ncompany restructuring, etc.) which might affect his or her status. The adjudicator reviewing the advisory \\nrequest must either recommend the filing of another application, or prepare a new I-797 reflecting the \\nnon-substantive changes.\",\n",
       "  \"(f) Technical Issues . \\n(1) Trade . \\nSee 8 CFR 214.2(e)(9) discussion of the broad definition of trade, including goods, services, technology, \\ntourism and other intangible items with intrinsic value. The trade must be substantial as defined in 8 CFR \\n214.2(e)(10) and occur principally between the U.S. and the treaty country, as discussed in 8 CFR \\n214.2(e)(11) . \\n(2) Nature of Employment . \\nThe E -1 applicant may be an owner of the company or an employee of the company. The employment \\nmust be in a managerial capacity or one which requires special technical knowledge. This employment is \\nnot unlike the type of employment which would qualify for an L -1 visa. Discussions found in various \\nprecedent decisions pertaining to L -1 classification are helpful in deciding E -1 cases as well. \\nA qualified technician (somewhat lower than the L -1 “specialized knowledge” qualifications) may also be \\nclassified as a treaty trader if he or she has special qualifications essential to the efficient operation of the \\nbusiness. For example, if he or she will be engaged in performing warranty repairs on intricate and \\ncomplex products sold in the course of trade between the U.S. and that country, and it appears t he firm is \\notherwise unable to obtain the services of technicians in the U.S. to perform such repa irs. When granting \\nan extension of stay to such a technician, or a change of status to that of a treaty trader, the employing firm \\nshall be advised that the action has been taken with the understanding that the employer will utilize U.S. \\ncitizens or permanent resident aliens, as such persons become available to make the repairs or to be trained. When the employing firm has been so notified, the alien's Form I -539 should be annotated to so indicate. \\nIf the alien should subsequently apply for a further extension of stay, the adjudicator shall determine what \\nsteps the firm has taken to train or employ resident U.S. workers to perform the specialty work. The \\nextens ion should not be granted if it appears the firm has failed to make serious efforts to comply with the \\nnotification. \\n(3) Ownership of an E -1 Company .\",\n",

Applicant for admission who will supervise and \\ntrain American workers as tempura cooks at a Japanese restaurant and assist in the preparation of meals \\nduring the training period is inadmissible as an employee of a treaty investor because he will not be \\nemployed in a \"responsible capacity\" with the meaning of 22 CFR 41.51. \\n· Matter of Laigo , 15 I&N Dec. 65 (BIA 1974). A treaty investor is precluded from engaging in \\nunauthorized employment by the provisions of both 8 CFR 214.1(e) and 8 CFR 214.2(e).

An application filed under \\nsection 248 of the Act for change of nonimmigrant classification from visitor to treaty investor is denied \\nwhere the applicant\\'s only showing was that he intended to invest $10,400 on deposit in a savings account in a shoe manufacturing business.

In \\nparticular, pursuant to section 214(i)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, “specialty occupation” \\nmeans an occupation that requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized \\nknowledge, and attainment of a bachelor’s or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a \\nminimum for entry into the occupation. As such, in order to be eligible for an E -3 classification, an alien \\nmust be able to show he or she will be employed in a specialty occupation in the U.S. and he or she possesses the required U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree (or its equivalen t) in the specific specialty to meet \\nthe minimum requirement for entry into the occupation in the U.S. \\n(A) Change of Status . \\nAn alien is also expected to meet any other occupational requirements specified by the jurisdiction in \\nwhich the alien will be employed, such as licensure or other official permission to practice in the \\noccupation in question. An alien seeking to change status to E -3 must submit a certified copy of any license \\nor other official permission to practice the specialty occupation in the jurisdiction of intended employment, \\nif such licensure or other official permission is required in order to commence the duti es of the specialty occupation. If licensure is unnecessary to start employment immediately in the intended specialty \\noccupation, the alien must s ubmit evidence that he or she otherwise meets the requirements for obtaining \\nthe license or taking the relevant jurisdiction’s licensure examination, as well as evidence that he or she \\nwill, upon passage of the examination, be obtaining the required license within a reasonable period of time \\nafter being granted E -3 classification.',\n",
       "  '(B) Extension of Stay. \\nFor E- 3 aliens applying to extend their stay in the U.S. in a specialty occupation that requires a license or \\nother official permission to practice in the specialty occupation, the alien must submit, together with his or \\nher extension application, a copy of the license or proof of other official permission to practice the \\noccupation in the jurisdiction of intended employment . \\n(3) Length of Stay . \\nE-3 Specialty Occupation Workers may be admitted initially for a period not to exceed the validity period \\nof the accompanying E -3 labor attestation (i.e., for a maximum of two years), and extensions of stay may \\nbe granted indefinitely in increments not to exceed the validity period of the accompanying E -3 labor \\nattestation (i.e., for increments of up to two years each). As there is no limit on the total length of stay for \\nan E-3 alien in the legislation, there is no specified number of extensions a qualify ing E -3 Specialty \\nOccupation Worker may be granted. Under the current E regulation, 8 CFR 214.2(e)(5) , an alien \\nclassified under section 101(a)(15)(E) as an E -3 nonimmigrant shall maintain an intention to depart the \\nUnited States upon the expiration of termination of E status. An application for initial admission, change of status or extension of stay in E -3 classification, however, may not be denied solely on the basis of an \\napproved request for permanent labor certification or a filed or approved im migrant visa preference \\npetition. \\n(4) Educational Requirements. \\nAn E-3 alien must be able to show that he or she possess the required U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree (or \\nits equivalent) in the specific specialty. \\n(5) Labor Attestation . \\nA certified labor attestation must have been issued on behalf of the E -3 Specialty Occupation Worker (in the \\nform specified by the Department of Labor.)',\n",

[Section (b) amended 10/6/2010; AD10- 48; PM -602- 0009] \\n(a) Current Law . \\nThe present nonimmigrant temporary worker categories have changed significantly, becoming more \\nrestrictive in some ways and more generous in others, in several stages since 1986. Current law provides for the admission of several specific categories of temporary workers (H nonimmigrant categories, as well \\nas L, O and P categories discussed in other chapters of this manual): \\n·  H-1B classification, created by Public Law 101- 238 (1989) (and the Immigration Nursing Relief Act \\nwhich also created the now defunct H1 -A nurse classification) and modified by Public Law 101 -649 \\n(1990) is reserved for aliens employed in “specialty occupations”, defined as in section 214(i) and for \\nfashion models of “distinguished merit and ability”; \\n·  H-1C classification, created by Public Law 106- 95 (1999), is reserved for registered nurses employed \\nin specifically designated nursing shortage areas; ·  H-2A classification, created by Public Law 99 -603 (1986), is reserved for temporary or seasonal \\nagricultural workers; \\n·  H-2B classification, created by Public Law 99 -603 (1986), is reserved for other temporary workers; \\n·  H-3 classification is reserved for “industrial trainees” who will not primarily be engaged in productive \\nlabor. Each o f these categories is precisely defined in section 101(a)(15)(H) of the Act and the petition \\nrequirements for each are set out in 8 CFR 214.2(h) . \\n(b) Prior Laws .',\n",
       "  'The Immigration Act of 1952 established a new nonimmigrant class of temporary workers. In these \\nprovisions, Congress sought to grant the Attorney General sufficient authority to admit temporarily certain \\nalien workers, industrial, agricultural, or otherwise, for the purpose of alleviating labor shortages as they exist or may develop in cert ain areas or certain branches of American productive enterprises, particularly in \\nperiods of intensified production. The provisions also enabled foreign trainees to acqui re the knowledge of \\nAmerican industrial, agricultural, and business methods. In 1970, Congress eliminated the requirement that \\nan alien of distinguished merit and ability must be coming to a temporary position. However, both the petitioner and the beneficiary must intend that the employment be for a temporary period of time. Also, in \\nthat year Congress added another new immigrant category, the L -1, intracompany transferee. \\nPrior to 1989, there were three H nonimmigrant worker classifications. The H -1 category included all \\n“persons of distinguished merit and ability” which was generously interpreted to include all persons \\nengaged in occupations which required a bachelor’s degree or equivalent. Also included were registered nurses, athletes, artists and entertainers. There was no maximum time limit on the total period of stay or \\nnumber of extensions which could be approved for an H -1, although in practice an H -1 requesting an e \\nxtension beyond five years was generally denied as an “intending immigrant.” There was no limit on the \\nnumber of H -1 aliens who could be admitted to the United States on an annual basis, nor was there any \\nlabor market test required. Among the professions, only medical doctors, other than those entering to perform teaching or research, were precluded from the H -1 classification. \\nIn 1986, Pub. L 99 -603 created a separate H -2A category for temporary/seasonal agricultural workers. \\nOther temporary workers were redesignated as H- 2B. \\nIn 1989, Pub. L. 101- 238 created a separate category (H -1A) for registered nurses. This Act also \\nredesignated the existing H -1 category as H1-B. The H -1A category was permitted to sunset on September \\n1, 1995, with some nurses granted extensions in the category through September 30, 1997. On November \\n12, 1999, the category was replaced by the present, more restrictive, H -1C category created by Pub. L. \\n106-95. \\nIn 1990, athletes and entertainers, as well as prominent persons in business, science and education were separated into the new O and P categories as a result of Pub. L 101-649, and the definition of H -1B \\nchanged from an alien of “distinguished merit and ability” to one coming to perform “services in a \\nspecialty occupation.” In addition, numerical limitations on new admissions of H -1B, H -2A and H -2B',\n",

L 101-649, and the definition of H -1B \\nchanged from an alien of “distinguished merit and ability” to one coming to perform “services in a \\nspecialty occupation.” In addition, numerical limitations on new admissions of H -1B, H -2A and H -2B \\nnonimmigrants were imposed for the first time. Further, the new law imposed a “labor condition \\napplication” p rovision that required the employer to pay any H -1B worker the higher of the actual or \\nprevailing wage for the occupation in the local area of employment. The requirement that an alien have a residence in a foreign country which he has no intention of abandoning was also removed from the H -1 \\nand L nonimmigrant classifications; however, limits were imposed on the amount of time an alien could remain in H -1B or P status. The H -2 and H -3 nonimmigrant classifications retained the foreign re sidence',\n",
       "  'requirement, and the new O, P, and Q nonimmigrant classifications also required that the alien have a \\nresidence in a foreign country which he or she has no intention of abandoning. \\nIn 1991, the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments further modified \\nthe H -1B definition by including fashion models in the category. \\nIn 1998, the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 (ACWIA) mandated that \\nmost H -1B petitioners pay an additional fee (originally $500, later raised to $1,000) which is designated \\nfor the funding of training programs for American workers. \\nIn 2000, three significant pieces of legislation affecting H nonimmigrants were enacted. On October 17, \\n2000, the President approved enactment of The American Competitiveness in the Twenty -First Century Act \\nof 2000 (AC21), Public Law 106 -313. On the same date, the President also approved enactment of Public \\nLaw 106 -311, an untitled bill to increase the fee for certain H -1B petitions. Finally, on October 30, 2000, \\nthe President approved enactment of Public Law 106- 396, the Visa Waiver Permanent Program Ac t (Visa \\nWaiver Act). These amendments made the following changes: \\n· Publi c Law 106 -313: \\n– Increased the numerical limitation on the H -1B nonimmigrant classification to 195,000 for fiscal year \\n2001 through fiscal year 2003; – Allowed for the continued H -1B employment of certain H -1B nonimmigrant aliens who change H -1B \\nemployers; – Exempted certain H -1B nonimmigrants from the annual numerical limitation; \\n– Allowed certain aliens who have applied for adjustment of status to change employers under certain \\nconditions;',\n",
       "  '– Allowed INS (now USCIS) to grant an extension of stay to H -1B nonimmigrant aliens who are the \\nbeneficiaries of employment -based petitions under certain circumstances; \\n– Modified the method of counting H -1B nonimmigrant aliens; \\n– Provided that certain H -1B petitions that are revoked because of fraud or willful misrepresentation shall \\nbe subtracted from the numerical count for the year in which the petition was revoked; \\n· Public Law 106- 311: \\n– Increased the additional filing fee for certain H -1B petitions to $1,000, with some exceptions; \\n· Public Law 106- 396: \\n– Amended section 214 of the Act to address whether an amended petition is required of an H -1B \\npetitioner when the petitioner undergoes corporate restructuring. \\nOn November 2, 2002, President Bush signed into law the Twenty -First Century Department of Justice \\nAppropriations Authorization Act (21 st Century DOJ Appropriations Act). One section of the new law \\namends § 106(a) of the American Competitiveness in the Tw enty-first Century Act (AC21) by making the \\nfollowing change: \\n· Public Law 107- 273: \\n– Removes the six -year limitation on H -1B status for certain aliens on whose behalf an alien labor \\ncertification or employment -based (EB) immigrant petition has been pending for 365 days or more. \\nOn December 8, 2004, President George W. Bush signed the Omnibus Appropriations Act of FY 2005 (also \\nknown as the H -1B Visa Reform Act) into law. This act:',\n",
       "  \"• Reinstated and increased an additional filing fee to $1,500 f or certain H -1B petitions filed by \\npetitioners with more than 25 employees in the United States, with some exceptions. This is \\nknown as the ACWIA (American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998) fee. \\n• Set the additional fee at $750 for certain H -1B petitions filed by petitioners with 25 or fewer \\nemployees in the United States, with some exceptions. \\n• Instituted a Fraud Prevention and Detection Fee of $500 for the first H -1B petition filed by a \\nparticular petitioner on behalf of a specific benef iciary on or after March 8, 2005. \\nOn August 13, 2010, President Barack Obama signed Public Law 111- 230. Public Law 111- 230: \\n• Requires the submission of an additional fee of $2,000 for certain H -1B petitions where those \\npetitions are postmarked on or after August 14, 2010; \\n• Applies if: \\no The H -1B petitioner employs 50 or more employees in the United States; and \\no More than 50 percent of the petitioner's employees in the United States are in H -1B, L -1A, \\nor L-1B nonimmigrant status; and \\n• Will remain in effect through September 30, 2014.\",\n",
       "  '31.2 General Requirements for H Petitions.  \\n \\n(a) General .  \\n \\n \\nPetition filing requirements, requirements for maintaining status and requirements for obtaining an \\nextension of stay or change of nonimmigrant status are discussed in Chapter 30 of this manual. Gene ral \\nadjudicative practices are discussed in Chapter 10 . The remainder of this chapter deals with the \\nadjudication of I- 129 petitions for all H -class temporary workers. Regulations governing the filing and \\nadjudication of these petitions may be located at 8 CFR 214.2(h) . Also helpful are the instructions for \\nForm I -129 . These regulations and instructions are detailed and somewhat complex, because the \\nrequirements of the statute itself are complex.  \\n \\n \\n(b) Filing of Petitions .  \\n \\n \\n(1) Filing Location .  \\n \\n \\nA petition to classify a worker under section 101(a)(15)(H) of the Act must be filed with the service center \\nwhich has jurisdiction over H petitions in the area of intended employment, except in emergent situations. Petitions are f iled at the service center unless there is an emergent situation as directed by HQOPRD. In \\nsuch a case, the district officer must obtain a file number from the service center and send the file to the \\nservice center after disposition for records retention. The service centers do n ot have jurisdiction over \\nspecial filing situations, such as petitions for Canadian woodsmen. Such petitions are filed with the local \\ndistrict office or a designated USCIS office. (See Appendix 31- 4 for a list of such “special fili ng situation” \\ncases.)  \\n \\n \\n(2) Who Can File .  \\n \\n \\nAlthough the statute requires the employer to file an H petition, USCIS allows others to file for the employer \\nto accommodate some situations.  \\n \\n \\n·     H-1B petition. A U.S. employer or an agent where appropriate may file the petition.',\n",
       "  \"·     H-1C petition. A “facility” as defined by Department of Labor regulations at 20 CFR 655.1102 may file \\nthe petition.  \\n \\n \\n·     H-2A petition. A U.S. employer, the employer's agent, or an association of U.S. agricultural pr oducers \\nnamed as a joint employer on the labor certification may file the petition.  \\n \\n \\n·     H-2B petition. A U.S. employer, a U.S. agent, or a foreign employer filing through a U.S. agent may file \\nthe petition.  \\n \\n \\n·     H-3 petition. A U.S. employer must file the petition.  \\n \\n \\n(3) Services in More than One Location .  \\n \\n \\nSuch petitions are usually filed by an agent who is representing numerous employers in various locations, \\nor by one employer which has work to be performed by the beneficiary in more than one location. A \\ndetailed itinerary is required to accompany the petition. The procedure where each employer must file a separate petition in order for the alien to work part -time for multiple employers does not apply in petitions \\nfiled by agents. [See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(B) .]  \\n \\n \\n(4) Amended Petition .  \\n \\n \\nAn amended petition requires the same filing fee as a new petition. Because the amended petition \\nsupplements the original petition, documentation does not have to be duplicated in the amended petition. However, an amended petition must be accompanied by evidence addressing the change which necessitated the filing of the amended petition.  \\n \\n \\n(5) Agents as Petitioners .\",\n",
       "  \"A United States agent may file a petition in cases involving workers who are traditionally self -employed or \\nworkers who use agents to arrange short -term employment on their behalf with numerous employers, and \\nin cases where a foreign employer authorizes the agent to act in it behalf. A United States agent may be:  \\n \\n \\n·     The actual employer of the beneficiary;  \\n \\n \\n·     The representative of both the employer and the beneficiary;  \\n \\n \\n·     A person or entity authorized by the employer to act for, or in the place of, the employer as its agent.  \\n \\n \\nWhenever the beneficiary(ies) will be employed by a single employer, the actual employer(s) must file the \\npetition. USCIS reserves the right to require information from the actual employers and beneficiary(ies). The i tinerary of firm engagements provided by the agent is acceptable in lieu of signed contracts, unless the \\nadjudicator has reason to believe the statements are not true and correct. However, the adjudicator should request any additional information from the petitioning agent. Speculative employment should not be \\nincluded in an itinerary. When the agent, such as a modeling agency, is functioning as the employer, a co \\nntract between the agency and the alien, guaranteeing the wages and conditions of employment, must \\naccompany the petition.  \\n \\n \\n(6) Named Beneficiaries .  \\n \\n \\nNonagricultural H petitions must identify the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) by name and other information \\nrequired on Form I -129 , except in emergent situations involving multiple H -2B aliens. [ See 8 CFR \\n214.2(h)(2)(iii) .]  \\n \\n \\n(A) Emergent Situations .  \\n \\n \\nThe decision not to require names in an emergent situation is a discretionary one which the director must \\nmake. The petitioner's inability to provide names at the time the petition is adjudicate d should be due to \\ncircumstances which the petitioner could not anticipate or could not control. The names and evidence that\",\n",
       "  'the aliens meet the requirements of the labor certification must be provided by the petitioner to the port of \\nentry or the consular  officer prior to their admission at a port of entry or applic ation for a visa.  \\n \\n \\n(B) Multiple Petitions Using the Same Labor Certification .  \\n \\n \\nThe petitioner may file multiple petitions at different times as the names of aliens become known, and use \\ncopies of the same labor certification until all of the positions covered by the labor certification have been \\nfilled. Each subsequent petition must refer to the petition number of all previously filed petitions using that labor certification, if available to the petitioner.  \\n \\n \\n(7) Multiple Petitions .  \\n \\n \\nAn H -1B beneficiary can work simultaneously for more than one employer, provided each files a sepa rate \\npetition with its own LCA. Such separate petitions are not necessary if an agent serves as the sole petitioner.  \\n \\n \\n(c) Effect of a Prior H -petition Approval .  \\n \\n \\nEvidence of prior approvals as a form of documentation on a subsequent new petition cannot serve as the \\nbasis for future eligibility. Knowledge of prior approval of an H petition can be helpful to USCIS when \\nconsidered along with other evidence eligibility . A prior approval, however, does not obligate USCIS to \\napprove a subsequent petition or relieve the petitioner of providing sufficient documentation to establish \\ncurrent eligibility.  \\n \\n \\n(d) Limits on a Temporary Stay . [Chapter 31.2(d) revised 12 -05-2006]   \\n \\n \\n(1)     Principal Alien .  \\n \\n \\nSpecific limits on what is regarded as a temporary period of stay in all H classifications are included in the',\n",
       "  \"regulations to reflect the temporary nature of these classifications and to achieve consistency in the \\nhandling of requests for extensions of stay.  \\n \\n \\nThe maximum time limit in an H classification and the requirement to reside abroad upon expiration of \\nthis period cannot be avoided by leaving the United States before the expiration of the maximum time limit \\nand reen tering within a short period of time under a new petition. In such cases, the approval period of the \\nnew petition shall be consistent with and count towards the maximum time limit on an alien's temporary \\nstay.  \\n \\n \\nA new period of authorized stay may begin only when the alien has resided outside the United States for a \\nperiod required by the classification, or when the alien qualifies for an exemption from limits on the \\nmaximum period of stay as discussed below.  \\n \\n \\n(2)     Spouse and Dependents .  \\n \\n \\nLimitations on the duration of time spent in H -1B, H -2, or H -3 nonimmigrant status refer only to the \\nprincipal worker in H status and do not apply independently to the principal worker's dependent spouse \\nand children. Normal rules for maintenance of derivative stat us still apply such that the dependent may \\nremain in the United States only for the purpose of family unity with the principal worker.  \\n \\n \\nTime spent as an H -4 dependent does not count against the maximum allowable period of stay for \\nprincipals in H -1B, H -2, or H -3 status. Thus, a foreign national who was previously an H -4 nonimmigrant \\nand subsequently becomes an H -1B, H -2, or H -3 principal may be eligible for the maximum period of stay \\nallowed under the H -1B, H -2 orH -3 classifications. Furthermore, a principal H -1B, H -2, or H -3 \\nnonimmigrant who subsequently changes to H -4 status may remain in the new derivative status for as long \\nas the principal foreign national spouse maintains that principal status. The application for a change of \\nstatus to H -4 must be pr operly filed before the H -1B, H -2, or H -3 foreign national has spent the maximum \\nallowable period of stay in the United States.  \\n \\n \\nUSCIS may limit, deny, or refer for removal an H -4 dependent that is not primarily intended for the \\npurpose of being with the  principal worker in the United States. Therefore, a spouse or child may be \\nrequired to show that the requested stay is not intended to evade the normal requirements of the \\nnonimmigrant classification that otherwise would apply when the principal foreign national is absent from \\nthe United States.\",\n",
       "  'USCIS officers may adjudicate applications for dependent stays in order to prevent an H -1B nonimmigrant \\nfrom using only occasional work visits to the United States in order to \"park\" the family members in the United States for extended periods while the principal alien is normally absent.  \\n \\n \\n(3)     Seasonal, Intermittent or Aggregate Periods of Employment of Six Months or Less .  \\n \\n \\nThe limitation on the total period of stay does not apply to H -1B, H -1C, H -2B, or  H-3 aliens who do not \\nreside continually in the United States and whose employment in the United States is seasonal or intermittent or for an aggregate of six months or less per year.  \\n \\n \\nFurther, the limitations do not apply to aliens who reside abroad an d regularly commute to the United \\nStates to engage in part -time employment. To qualify for this exception, the petitioner and the alien must \\nprovide clear and convincing proof that the alien qualifies for such an exception. Such proof shall consist of \\nevidence such as arrival and departure records, copies of tax returns, and records of employment abroad.  \\n \\n \\n(4)     Exemptions to Limitations of Stay . . [Updated May 28, 2008]  \\n \\n \\nThe limitation on the total period of stay does not apply to H 1B aliens when, as of the date of filing the \\nextension request:  \\n \\n \\n·     365 or more days have passed since the filing of any application for labor certification, Forms ETA 750 \\nhttp://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/750inst.cfm or ETA 9089, that is required or used by the alien to \\nobtain status as an EB immigrant; and the labor certification, if approved, has not been revoked, is unexpired or has been timely filed with an EB petition within the labor certification\\'s validity period; or  \\n \\n \\n·     365 or more days have passed since the filing of an EB immigrant petition that is still pending; or  \\n \\n \\n·     The alien is the beneficiary of an approved EB immigration petition and is not able to file to a djust \\nstatus to U.S. permanent legal residence based on the unavailability of an immigrant visa number.',\n",

Extension of H -1B status for a liens with \\nlengthy adjudications” on the i- link Public Laws Amending the INA], Congress provided exemptions from \\nmaximum stay rules for certain H -1B aliens who were being sponsored by employers for permanent \\nresidence and were subject to long delays either  for government processing or for visa numbers.  \\n \\n \\nThe relevant subsections emphasize exemption from the maximum admission under INA section 214(g)(4). Congress did not restrict eligibility for additional periods of admission beyond the maximum \\nsix years t o only requests for extension of stay.  \\n \\n \\nA qualified alien need not be in H -1B status in order to benefit from sections 106 and 104(c) of AC21. The \\nalien may obtain such additional periods of H -1B admission through a petition to change status from \\nanother  nonimmigrant classification, or through H -1B visa issuance at a U.S. consulate (unless visa exempt) \\nand admission from abroad.  \\n \\n \\nNote:   \\nThe burden of proof rests with the petitioner and alien to establish his or her eligibility for any \\nadditional periods of stay in H -1B status beyond the six year maximum, including evidence of job \\nrequirements, alien credentials, labor condition application approval, previous H -1B status, pending \\nlabor certification or immigrant petition, and unavailabil ity of immigrant visa number, and admissibility \\nor maintenance of nonimmigrant status.   \\n \\n(e) Amended Petitions .  \\n \\n \\nAn amended petition must be filed when there is a material change in the terms and conditions of \\nemployment or the beneficiary's eligibili ty.

       "  \"·     When a beneficiary is transferred from one employer to another, the filing of a new petition ensures \\nthat the new employer is liable f or the alien's return transportation abroad and that the employer files a \\nlabor condition application.  \\n \\n \\n·     A change of the alien's duties from one specialty occupation to another.  \\n \\n \\n·     When a beneficiary is transferred from a firm to another firm within the same organization, and the \\nnew firm becomes the beneficiary's employer.

[Section (h) added 10/6/2010; \\nAD10- 48; PM -602- 0009]  \\n \\n(a) Definitions .  \\n \\n \\nThe following terms relate directly to the H -1B temporary worker classification. Adjudicators should be \\nfamiliar with these terms. Some of the terms have been used in other contexts under prior law.  \\n \\n \\n(1) Specialty Occupation .  \\n \\n \\nThe term “specialty occupation” is defined in section 214(i)(1) of the Act and described in 8 \\nCFR214.2(h)(4)(ii) . The term was created by the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), although its \\ndefinition was taken from prior case law which related to “professional” occupations which qualified for \\npre-IMMACT H -1 status. An alien may qualify for a specialty occupation by virtue of formal education, \\nexperience, or a combination of both. However, do not rely on pre -IMMACT precedent case law for \\nguidance on specialt y occupations. While there are no published precedent decisions on this subject, \\nservice centers (where virtuall y all such cases are filed) may find prior non -published appellate orders as \\nuseful guidance and training material.

A similar \"catch \\n22\" scenario exists where a State requires an applicant for a license to present a social security number that \\nis valid for employment but the alien cannot obtain a social security numbe r until he or she has been \\ngranted H -1 B status. (Paragraph (d) (3) added 03- 21-08. AD08 -10)  \\n Under such circumstances, adjudicators should verify that that the alien beneficiary is fully qualified to \\nreceive the State or local license, meaning that all educational, training, experience, and other substantive \\nrequirements must be met at the time of filing the petition. The petitioner must demonstrate that the alien \\nbeneficiary has in fact filed an application for such State or local license in accordance with the \\nrequirements of the State or local jurisdiction in advance of being granted employment authorization in the \\nU.S. Adjudicators are instructed to approve the petition for a one -year validity period, provided that the \\nsole reason why the alien beneficiary does not possess such license is that the appropriate licensing \\nauthority will not grant such license to an alien absent evidence that the alien has been grante d H-1 B \\nstatus. Approval of such a petition does not constitute authorization by USCIS for the alien to engage in any activities requiring such licensure. Any petition that requests an extension of stay beyond the one -year \\nvalidity period on behalf an alie n who has been granted H -1 B status under this pr ovisional measure must \\nshow that the alien has obtained the requisite license.

There are numerous references available \\n(such as the DOL’s Occupational Outlook Handbook) to describe specific vocational preparation for various \\noccupations. However, it is important to note that occupations are rapidly evolving an d job titles \\nthemselves are often meaningless. In order to correctly adjudicate a case, it is necessary to consider all the \\nfacts surrounding the petition: the beneficiary’s education and work experience, the nature of the \\npetitioner’s business, industry practice, and salary (both offered to the beneficiary and typical for the \\nindustry). It is important not to be so influenced by a single factor, such as the job title or salary, that other indicators are overlooked. If significant doubts exist regarding the beneficiary’s work experience, the \\nadjudicating officer may request an overseas investigation (see Chapter 10.5(d) ) or refer the case to the \\nappropriate local ICE office for interview, field examination (see Chapter 17 ), or local investigation.  \\n \\n \\n(2) Equivalency of Experience and Education .  \\n \\n \\nOne of the most common situations an adjudicator will encounter is an H -1B petition filed for an alien in \\nspecialty occupation where the alien lacks a U.S. bachelor’s degree. Adjudicators should be thoroughly \\nfamiliar with 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(D) which describes the kind and amount of experience which can be \\nused to establish the equivalence of a degree. Three years of professional experience may be used to substitute for each year of college -level training. The most critical aspect of this type of adjudication is \\ndeciding whether the quality of experience is at high enough level to qualify as “professional.” Experience \\nis generally documented through letters from past employers and may be so lacking in specific ity as to \\nmake the qualitative determination difficult or impossible. The regulations for deciding equivalency are \\nvery specific and must be closely followed.  \\n \\n \\nForeign educational credentials, licenses and other forms of documentation are easier to evaluate than \\nexperience. The petitioner may establish from an authoritative source or from transcripts, certificates, or \\nother such school records that the alien has college -level education. College -level training may have been',\n",
       "  \"acquired at a college or univers ity or other academic institution which grants a degree, diploma, or \\ncertificate, such as a technical college. It may be useful to compare the beneficiary’s age a t completion and \\nthe duration of the course of study, with the average age of graduates of United States institutions offering \\nsimilar programs as a factor in determining equivalency of education.  \\n \\n \\nSpecialized training may have been acquired through an apprenticeship program, employee -sponsored \\ntraining courses, vocational training schools, or other commercial training facilities. The starting and \\nending dates of all training in the field must be shown. Training certificates and an outline or summary of \\nthe curriculum should be submitted.  \\n \\n \\nMembership in a professional association, per se , is insufficient evidence of equivalency. An association \\nwhich grants certification or registration in the profession should have an accrediting body which has standards for the profession, and which issues an official document to applicants verifying that they  have \\nbeen awarded professional credentials in the profession. The standards of the organization should be \\nreviewed to ensure that bachelor’s degree or higher, or its equivalent, is required for membership.  \\n \\n \\nIn suspect cases, overseas experience can be v erified by the overseas DHS office (see Chapter 10.5(d) on \\nrequesting an overseas investigation) . Such investigations should not be routinely requested, but can be \\nused when all other avenues have been explored and there is still serious doubt about claim ed experience.  \\n \\n \\n(3) Unsolicited Evaluations .  \\n \\n \\nAn evaluation by an official who has authority to grant college -level credit at an accredited college or \\nuniversity with training and/or work experience in the profession can also be used to support an \\nequivalency claim. USCIS does not require the alien to be enrolled in a program for college credit at the \\nuniversity in order to accept the evaluation of such an expert. However, the official must be formally \\ninvolved with the college or university's official  program for granting credit based on training and/ or \\nexperience to have the required authority and expertise to make such evaluations. The evaluation may be \\ndone in the official's name as an individual, or as an authorized representative of the college or university. \\nAny such evaluation should be given considerable weight in determining eligibility.  \\n \\n \\nResults of recognized college -level equivalency examinations or special credit programs, such as the College \\nLevel Examination Program (CLEP), or Program on Noncollegiate Sponsored Instruction (PONSI) must be \\ntranslated into college credits by an authoritative source in the particular program or by an authorized \\nofficial from an accredited college or university, such as the registrar, in order for the result s to be applied \\ntowards the degree requirement.\",\n",
       "  \"There are a number of outside organizations which evaluate educational credentials to determine degree \\nequivalency. Some organizations may also provide an opinion on the equivalency of experience to educat ion. It is important that the adjudicator distinguish between these two types of evaluations. The latter \\ntype of evaluation carries little weight . Although USCIS does not specifically recognize or accredit any sources of evaluations, foreign educational degree evaluations can be of assistance if they are thorough, well documented and specific in reaching an equivalency determination.  \\n \\n \\n(4) Assessing the Needs of the Petitioner for the Services of the Beneficiary .  \\n \\n \\nThis issue is occasionally present in H-1B petitions filed by small businesses for aliens with professional \\nskills not normally associated with persons employed in such a business (e.g., a petition for an accountant \\nfiled by an auto repair business or restaurant). Often, such petitions are fil ed by a relative or family friend \\nas an accommodation to the beneficiary. Either the beneficiary will be employed in a lesser capacity or he \\nor she will seek other employment immediately upon arrival. The burden of pr oof falls on the petitioner to \\ndemonst rate the need for such an employee. Unless you are satisfied that a legitimate need exists, such a \\npetition may be denied because the petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the beneficiary will be \\nemployed in a qualifying specialty occupation.  \\n \\n \\n(5) De termining the Petitioner’s Ability to Pay the Required Wage .  \\n \\n \\nThis issue, like the preceding one, is most commonly associated with small enterprises which do not necessarily have the assets required to pay the salary guaranteed in the petition. Such a petition may be an \\naccommodation to a relative or friend who will seek other employment or there may be an agreement to \\nwork for lower wages. It is not necessary that complete financial data be submitted with every H -1B \\npetition. However, if in the discreti on of the adjudicating officer the financial condition of the pet itioner is \\nso questionable as to call into question whether the petitioner really intends to employ the alien as claimed, \\nevidence of financial ability may be requested. This is because the financial standing of the petitioner, when \\ntaken in consideration with other factors, may be indication that the petition is an accommodation and not a valid job offer. Other factors that may be examined include, but are not limited to, the nature of the \\npetitioner's business, the relationship between the beneficiary an d the owners/officers of the petitioning \\nentity, and the petitioner's immigration history.  \\n \\n \\n(6) Effect of Beneficiary’s Intent to Remain Permanently .\",\n",

[Updated May 28, 2008]  \\n \\n \\nThe American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 (ACWIA), Title IV of Div. C. of \\nPublic Law 105 -277 , was enacted on October 21, 1998. ACWIA provides for enhanced penalties against H \\n1B employers who violate attestations made on the LCA. Among these provisions for enhanced \\nenforcement are measures designed to enable and encourage H 1B workers  to report employers who violate \\ncertain attestations.  \\n \\n \\nAs a result, Section 212(n)(2)(C)(v) of the Act requires the creation of a process under which an H 1B \\nalien beneficiary who files a complaint regarding a violation of section 212(n)(2)(C)(iv) and is otherwise \\neligible to remain and work in the United States may in some circumstances be allow ed to seek other \\nappropriate employment in the United States for a period not to exceed the maximum period of stay \\nauthorized for such nonimmigrant classification.  \\n \\n \\nIf credible documentary evidence is provided in support of an H 1B petition that the H 1B alien beneficiary \\nfaced retaliatory action from his or her employer based on a report regarding a violation of section \\n212(n)(2)(C)(iv) of the INA, then USCIS adjudicators may consider any related loss of H 1B status by the \\nalien as an \"extraordinary circ umstance\" as defined by 8 CFR 214.1(c)(4) . This may allow the alien time \\nto acquire new H 1B employment and remain eligible to apply for a change of status or extension of stay notwithstanding the termination of employment or other retaliatory action by h is or her employer.  \\n \\n \\nSuch credible documentary evidence should include a copy of the complaint filed by the H 1B alien \\nbeneficiary, along with corroborative documentation that such a complaint has resulted in the termination \\nof employment of the H 1B alien beneficiary or other retaliatory action by his or her employer as described \\nin 20 CFR 655.801 http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text -\\nidx?c=ecfr&sid=67c132e3cef5a550b0c791e06ef979a4&rgn=div8&view=text&node=20:3.0.2.1.34.9.12.2\\n&idno=20 in pertinent par t:  \\n \\n \\n(A) No employer subject to this subpart I or subpart H of this part shall intimidate, threaten, restrain,',\n",

       "  'Note:   \\nParagraphs (A) and (B) above are INA subsections. Paragraphs (A) and (B) are not separate outline \\nheadings in this chapter.   \\n \\n(A)     “Employed (or has received an offer of employment) at”  \\n \\n \\n(i)     General Discussion  \\n \\n \\nSections 214(g)(5)(A) and (B) of the Act (Section 103 of AC21) exempt an alien from the H -1B cap if the \\nalien is “employed (or has received an offer of employme nt) at “an institution of higher education, a \\nrelated or affiliated nonprofit entity, a nonprofit research organization, or a governmental research \\norganization (hereinafter a “qualifying institution”).”  \\n \\n \\nCommonly, qualifying institutions petition on behalf of current or prospective H -1B employees and claim \\nthis exemption. In certain instances, petitioners that are not themselves a qualifying institution also claim this exemption because the alien beneficiary will perform all or a portion of the job dutie s “at” a qualifying \\ninstitution. For purposes of this paragraph, such petitioners are referred to as “third party petitioners.”  \\n \\n \\nA third party petitioner is one who petitions on behalf of an H -1B worker who will work “at” a qualifying \\ninstitution, but where the alien is or will be employed by the third party petitioner, not the qualifying \\ninstitution. These types of cases should be adjudicated based on the guidance provided below.  \\n \\n \\nCongress deemed certain institutions worthy of an H -1B cap exemption bec ause of the direct benefits they \\nprovide to the United States. Congressional intent was to exempt from the H -1B cap certain alien workers \\nwho could provide direct contributions to the United States through their work on behalf of institutions of \\nhigher education and related nonprofit entities, or nonprofit research organizations, or governmental \\nresearch organizations. In effect, this statutory measure ensures that qualifying institut ions have access to a \\ncontinuous supply of H -1B workers without numerical  limitation.  \\n \\n \\nCongress chose to exempt from the numerical limitations in section 214(g)(1) of the Act aliens who are \\nemployed “at” a qualifying institution, which is a broader category than aliens employed “by” a qualifying',\n",
       "  'institution. This broader cate gory may allow certain aliens who are not employed directly by a qualifying \\ninstitution to be treated as cap exempt when needed to further the essential purposes of the qualifying \\ninstitution.  \\n \\n \\nThus, if a petitioner is not itself a qualifying institution, the burden is on the petitioner to establish that that \\nthere is a logical nexus between the work predominately performed by the beneficiary and the normal \\nmission of the qualifying entity. Petitioners must therefore demonstrate how the beneficiary’s duties are \\ndirectly and predominately related to, and in furtherance of, the normal, primary or essential purpose, \\nmission, objectives or function of the qualifying institution, namely, higher educat ion or nonprofit or \\ngovernmental research.  \\n \\n \\nIn many instances, third -party petitioners seeking exemptions from the H -1B cap are companies that have \\ncontracts with qualifying federal agencies (or other qualifying institutions) which require the placement of \\nprofessionals on- site at the particular agency. The H -1B employees generally perform work directly related \\nto the purposes of the particular qualifying federal agency or entity and thus may qualify for an exemption \\nto the H -1B cap.  \\n \\n \\n(ii)     Examples  \\n \\n \\nAs qualifying third -party employment can occur in a variety of other ways, below is a non- exhaustive list \\nof examples to assist adjudicators in determining cap exemption eligibility:  \\n \\n \\nExample 1:   \\nCompany A, a for -profit consultant firm that would not o therwise be a qualifying institution, files an H -\\n1B petition on behalf of an employee working directly for the firm. The H -1B petition describes the alien \\nbeneficiary’s job duties, which will be performed on -site at a qualifying governmental research \\norgan ization pursuant to a joint -agreement between the two entities.   \\nCompany A submits evidence in support of its H -1B petition demonstrating that the alien beneficiary \\nwill be working on a research project performing duties similar to those performed by act ual employees \\nof the governmental research organization in furtherance of the qualifying entity’s mission. If the alien \\nbeneficiary was sponsored directly by the government research organization, he or she would clearly \\nqualify for the H -1B cap exemption.   \\nQ:     Would the alien beneficiary qualify for the H -1B exemption?',\n",
       "  'A:     Yes. In this case, the alien beneficiary would be exempt from the H -1B cap because the alien \\nbeneficiary will perform research duties that would or could otherwise be performed by employees of \\nthe qualifying institution, in furtherance of the qualifying institution’s primary mission.   \\n \\nExample 2:   \\nCompany B, a for -profit hospital and research center that would not otherwise be a qualifying \\ninstitution, files an H -1B petition  on behalf of a renowned oncologist who will be a direct employee of \\nthe hospital and whose duties will consist of clinical treatment of cancer patients and laboratory research \\non a new medication to treat liver cancer.   \\nCompany B maintains a relationship with a qualifying non -profit research organization dedicated to \\nfinding a cure for liver cancer, whereby Company B occasionally provides resources and data in \\nexchange for access to the non- profit’s national database on protocols for treating liver cancer.   \\nCompany B’s new oncologist will spend 55 percent (i.e., a majority) of her time working on -site at the \\nnon-profit research organization conducting research and laboratory experiments on the new medication \\nto treat liver cancer and accessin g the national database.   \\nThe oncologist will be performing sophisticated research and laboratory experiments that are not \\nnormally conducted by employees of the non- profit research organization but that, nonetheless, directly \\nand predominantly further t he normal, primary, or essential purpose, mission, objectives or function of \\nthe non -profit organization. Company B and the non -profit entity will collaborate on a joint paper \\npublishing the research.   \\nQ:     Would the oncologist qualify for an H -1B cap exemption based on this employment?   \\nA:     Yes. In this case, the oncologist’s work clearly furthers the overall mission of the qualifying non -\\nprofit research organization and benefits the United States. The fact that Company B and the qualifying non-profit entity share a cooperative relationship helps establish a sufficient nexus between the \\noncologist’s work and the normal, primary, or essential purpose, mission, objectives or function of the non-profit organization.   \\nFurther, the oncologist will spe nd more than half of her time working physically on -site “at” the \\nqualifying entity.   \\n \\nExample 3:   \\nA medical fellow in pediatrics has been employed at a qualifying non -profit university medical center for \\ntwo years in H -1B status.

       "  'Q:     Would the doctor qualify for an H -1B cap exemption based on this employment?   \\nA:     Yes. In this case, the doctor would be exempt from the H -1B cap because the conditions of \\nemployment demonstrate that the doctor will be performing the same work that he performed while \\nemployed directly by the qualifying university medical center. Thus, the H -1B employment directly \\nfurthers the primary mission of the hospital bec ause the doctor will remain on the university medical \\ncenter’s faculty, and will continue to educate and train its medical students and treat patients at the medical center.   \\n \\nExample 4:   \\nCompany D, a for -profit market research firm that would not othe rwise be a qualifying institution, files \\nan H-1B petition on behalf of a direct employee. The H -1B petition states that the alien beneficiary will \\nbe conducting a specific kind of market research on- site at a qualifying university. In addition, the \\npetition states that the university has a specialized research tool that can only be accessed from its \\nfacilities and that the alien beneficiary’s research will be conducted for the benefit of the petitioner’s \\nclients and business, and not for the university.   \\nQ:     Would the alien beneficiary qualify for the H -1B exemption based on this employment?   \\nA:     No. In this case, the alien would not qualify for a cap exemption as he or she is only physically \\nlocated “at” the qualifying institution and no nexus has  been demonstrated between the work performed \\nby the beneficiary and the normal purpose of the qualifying entity. The alien beneficiary will not \\nperform work for the benefit of the qualifying institution, but rather for the for -profit firm.   \\n \\n(B)     Institution of Higher Education or Related or Affiliated Nonprofit Entity  \\n \\n \\nThe H -1B regulations, in the context of qualifying for the H -1B fee exemption, directly adopt the definition \\nof institution of Higher Education set forth in section 101(a) of the Hig her Education Act of 1965. \\nAdjudicators should adopt the same definition for an institution of Higher Education for purposes of \\nexemptions from the H -1B cap.  \\n \\n \\nIn addition, the H -1B regulations define what is an affiliated nonprofit entity for purposes of  the H -1B fee \\nexemptions. Adjudicators should apply the same definitions to determine whether an entity qualifies as an \\naffiliated nonprofit entity for purposes of exemption from the H -1B cap.

In particular, as outlined in 8 C.F.R. 214.2(h)(19)(iii)(C) , the following definitions apply:  \\n \\n \\nA nonprofit research organization or governmental research organization . A nonprofit research \\norganization is an organization that is primarily engaged in basic research and/or applied research. A \\ngovernmental research organization is a United States Government entity whose primary mission is the performance or promotion of basic re search and/or applied research. Basic research is general research to \\ngain more comprehensive knowledge or understanding of the subject under study, without specific \\napplications in mind. Basic research is also research that advances scientific know ledge,  but does not have \\nspecific immediate commercial objectives although it may be in fields of present or potential commercial \\ninterest. It may include research and investigation in the sciences, social sciences, or humanities. Applied \\nresearch is research to  gain knowledge or understanding to determine the means by which a specific, \\nrecognized need may be met. Applied research includes investigations oriented to discovering new scientific knowledge that has specific commercial objectives with respect to products, processes, or services. \\nIt may include research and investigation in the sciences, social sciences, or humanities.  \\n \\n \\n(D) Requests for Changes in Employment or Concurrent Employment Requests for Certain Cap- Exempt \\nAliens.

Where multiple petitions are approved for 1 alien, that alien shall be counted only once.  \\n \\n \\nIn H-1 Recapture of T ime Spent Outside the United States, AAO Adopted Decision 06- 0001 (Sept. 2, \\n2005), USCIS has confirmed that the six -year period of maximum authorized admission accrues only \\nduring periods when the alien is lawfully admitted and physically present in the Un ited States.  \\n \\n \\nThe regulations at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(13)(i) provides that when an alien has reached the maximum period of \\nadmission, a new petition may be approved only if the alien has remained outside the United States for one \\nyear. The statute, regulations , and current policy guidance, however, do not clearly address situations \\nwhere an alien did not exhaust his or her maximum six -year period of admission.  \\n \\n \\nThere have been instances where an alien who was previously admitted to the United States in H -1B status, \\nbut did not exhaust his or her entire period of admission, seeks readmission to the United States in H -1B \\nstatus for the “remainder” of his or her initial six -year period of maximum admission, rather than seeking a \\nnew six -year period of admission. Pending the AC21 regulations, USCIS for now will allow an alien in the \\nsituation described above to elect either to:  \\n \\n \\n·     be re- admitted for the “remainder” of the initial six -year admission period without being subject to the \\nH-1B cap if previously counted; or  \\n \\n \\n·     seek to be admitted as a “new” H -1B alien subject to the H -1B cap.  \\n \\n \\nNOTE:   \\nThis new “remainder” policy does not affect an H -1B alien who was previously admitted to the United \\nStates, but who has not been absent from the United States for more than one year. Such an alien would',\n",
       "  'not be eligible for a new six -year period of admission and therefore may only seek readmission based on \\ntime remaining against his or her initial six -year period of admission.   \\n \\nSpecifically, the “remain der” period of the initial six -year admission period refers to the full six -year period \\nof admission minus the period of time that the alien previously spent in the United States in valid H -1B \\nstatus.  \\n \\n \\nFor example, an alien who spent five years in the Un ited States in H -1B status (from January 1, 1999 - \\nDecember 31, 2004), and then remained outside the United States for all of 2005, could seek to be \\nadmitted in January 2006 for the “remainder” of the initial six -year period, i.e., a total of one year.  \\n \\n \\nIf the alien was previously counted toward the H -1B numerical limitations in relation to the time that has \\naccrued against the six -year maximum period of admission, the alien would not be subject to the H -1B cap.  \\n \\n \\nIf the alien was not previously counted against the H -1B numerical limitations (i.e. because cap- exempt), \\nthe alien will be counted against the H -1B cap unless he or she is eligible for another exemption.  \\n \\n \\nAlternatively, admission as a “new” H -1B alien refers to a petition filed on behalf of a n H-1B alien who \\nseeks to qualify for a new six -year admission period (without regard to the alien’s eligibility for any \\n“remaining” admission period) after having been outside the United States for more than one year.  \\n \\n \\nFor example, the alien who spent f ive years in the United States in H -1B status (from January 1, 1999 - \\nDecember 31, 2004), and then remained outside the United States for all of 2005, is eligible to apply for a \\n“new” period of H -1B status based on his or her absence of at least one year f rom the United States. Most \\npetitioners electing this option will seek a three -year H -1B petition approval, allowing for the possibility of \\nlater seeking a three -year H -1B extension.  \\n \\n \\n“New” H -1B aliens are subject to the H -1B numerical limitations unless  they qualify for an exemption. See \\nSections 214(g)(1) and 214(g)(5) of the INA.  \\n \\n \\nNote:',\n",
       "  'T he burden of proof rests with the alien to show that he or she has been outside the United States for \\none year or more and is eligible for a new six -year period, or that he or she held H -1B status in the past \\nand is eligible to apply for admission for the H -1B “remainder” time.

Public Law 111 -230, enacted August 13, 2010, \\nrequires the submission of an additional fee of $2,000 for certain petitions seeking H -1B classification.  \\n(1) Definition of Employer. To determine who is subject to the additional fee of $2,000, USCIS will apply \\nthe definition of \"employer\" found at 8 CFR § 214.2(h)(4)(ii), whic h states:  \\n[A] person, firm, corporation, or other association, or organization within the United States which:  \\n(1) engages a person to work within the United States;  \\n(2) has an employer -employee relationship with respect to employees under this part, as indicated by the \\nfact that it may hire, pay, supervise, or otherwise control the work of any such employee; and  \\n(3) has an Internal Revenue Service Tax Identification Number.  \\nThe use of this definition for purposes of determining the application of this new fee does not extend or \\nauthorize its application beyond Public Law 111- 230 and the H -1B rules and regulations.  \\n(2) Counting Full -time and Part -time Employees. For the purposes of Public Law 111- 230, all employees, \\nwhether full -time or part -time, will count  towards the calculation of whether an employer is subject to the \\nnew fee.  \\n(3) U.S. and Foreign Payrolls. When calculating the percentage of employees in H -1B or L -1 status, all \\nemployees in the United States, regardless of whether they are paid through a U.S. or foreign payroll, will \\ncount toward the calculation.  \\n(4) Treatment of Petitions Filed Before Publication of Revised Forms. If either an initial petition for H -1B \\nclassification or an H -1B petition requesting a change of employer is filed before the revised Form I -129 is \\npublished, the adjudicator wil review any explanation or supporting evidence to determine whether the fee \\nrequired by Public Law 111 -230 applies to the petition, as explained in the following chart:  \\nIf… And…  And…  And…  Then…  \\nThe H -1B petition \\nis postmarked \\nbefore August 14, \\n2010  \\n    The fee does not \\napply; adjudicator \\ncan adjudicate the \\ncase. \\n \\nThe H -1B petition \\nseeking either (a) \\ninitial grant of nonimmigrant The petitioner has \\npaid the fee required by P.L. 111-230 OR the   The adjudicator \\ncan adjudicate the case.',\n",

(If a petition is denied, previously submitted fees will not be refunded.)  \\n(6) Treatment of Petitions Once Revised Form I -129 is Published. After the revised Form I- 129 is \\nimplemented, an H -1B petition subject to the additional fee that is submitted without the fee will be \\nrejected. Rejected filings do not retain a filing date. If, after the revised form  is implemented, an adjudicator \\nencounters an H -1B petition that was receipted without the additional fee and determines that the fee was \\nrequired, the adjudicator should issue a NOID soliciting the additional fee.

USCIS acknowledges that a sole stockholder of a corporation can be employed by that corporation as \\nthe corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners and even its sole owner. See Matter of Aphrodite, \\n17 I&N Dec. 530 (BIA 1980). [ http://www. justice.gov/eoir/vll/intdec/vol17/2826.pdf ] However, an \\nH-1B beneficiary/employee who owns a majority of the sponsoring entity and who reports to no one but \\nhim or herself may not be able to establish that a valid employment relationship exists in that the \\nbeneficiary, who is also the petitioner, cannot establish the requisite \"control\". See generally Administrator, \\nWage and Hour Division v. Avenue Dental Care, 6 -LCA-29 (ALJ June 28, 2007) at 20- 21.  \\n \\n \\n5.     The Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) of USCI S has issued an unpublished decision on the issue of \\nwhether a beneficiary may be \"employed\" by the petitioner even though she is the sole owner and operator \\nof the enterprise. The unpublished decisions of the AAO correctly determined that corporations are  separate \\nand distinct from their stockholders and that a corporation may petition for, and hire, their principal \\nstockholders as H -1B temporary employees.  \\n \\n \\n    However, the unpublished AAO decision did not address how, or whether, petitioners must establish \\nthat such beneficiaries are bona fide \"employees\" of \"United States employers\" having an \"employer -\\nemployee relationship.\" The AAO decision did not reach this pivotal analysis and thus, while it is correct \\nthat a petitioner may employ and seek H -1B cl assification for a beneficiary who happens to have a \\nsignificant ownership interest in a petitioner, this does not automatically mean that the beneficiary is a bo \\nna fide employee.  \\n \\n \\n6     Under 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(F) , it is also possible for an \"agent\"  who may not be the actual employer \\nof the H -1B temporary employee to file a petition on behalf of the actual employer and the beneficiary. The \\nbeneficiary must be one who is traditionally self -employed or who uses agents to arrange short -term \\nemployment o n their behalf with numerous employers. However, as discussed below, the fact that a \\npetition is filed by an agent does not change the requirement that the end- employer have a valid employer -\\nemployee relationship with the beneficiary.  \\n \\n \\n7.     8 CFR 214.2(h)(9)(i)  \\n \\n \\n8.

USCIS defers to the Department of Labor’s \\ndetermination on the temporary labor certification for H -2A employment as to whether the proffered \\nposition qualifies as agricultural. \\n(b) Definitions . \\n(1) Seasonal . \\nIn the H -2A context, employment is of a seasonal nature where it is tied to a certain time of the year by an \\nevent or pattern, suc h as a short annual growing cycle (including planting, thinning, harvesting, and \\nsimilar activities). It can also apply to a longer cycle. \\n(2) Temporary . \\nExcept in extraordinary circumstances, temporary agricultural employment does not last longer than one \\nyear. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(iv)(A) . Ordinarily, the certification by the Department of Labor (DOL) is \\nsufficient evidence that the employment is tempora ry. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(iv)(B) . When, however, \\nthe employer files a permanent certification for the same alien or another alien for the same position, or \\nwhere USCIS has other substantial evidence that it is not a temporary position, the petition will be denied. \\nId. \\n(c) Timely Processing .',\n",
       "  'On August 10, 2007, then -Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff announced a series of reforms \\nto include streamlining the H -2A program. As part of the reform process, it is USCIS’ goal to process all H -\\n2A petitions timely and efficiently. See Memorandum: Updated Procedures for H -2A (Agricultural Worker \\nI-129 Petitions (Oct. 19, 2007), Appendix 31- 2 . In accordance with the October 19, 2007 memo, USCIS \\nprovides special handling of H -2A petitions in which: \\n· Personnel in the Service Center mail room are instructed to generate fee receipts, enter data, and route \\nH-2A petitions for immediate distribution; \\n·  H-2A petitions are distributed to adjudication officers no later than the third day after receipt; \\n· Adjudications officers are reminded to adjudicate unnamed beneficiaries’ H -2A petitions on the day the \\ncases are assigned to them; and \\n· Once an H -2A approval notice is generated and printed, it should be sent to petitioners within 24 \\nhours of the decision. \\n(d) Labor Certification . \\nAn H -2A petition must be filed on Form I- 129 with a single valid temporary agricultural labor certification. \\nSee 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(i)(A) . Generally, the original temporary labor certification should be submitted to \\nUSCIS. However, a photocopied labor certification may be accepted by USCIS in cases where the petitioner \\nis filing multiple petitions using the same labor certification. \\nEach subsequent petition must reference all previously filed pet itions using the same temporary labor \\ncertification. The total number of beneficiaries of a petition or series of petitions based on the same \\ntemporary labor certification may not exceed the number of workers indicated on that document. See 8 \\nCFR 214.2(h)( 5)(i)(B) . \\nIn emergent circumstances, a single H -2A petition may be extended for a brief period of time up to two',\n",
       "  'weeks without extending the temporary labor certification. The H -2A worker, however, must continue to \\nbe employed by the same employer that obtained the previously approved petition and must continue to \\nperform the same duties. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(x) . \\n(e) H-2A Eligible Countries . \\nH-2A petitions may only be approved for nationals of countries that the Secretary of Homeland Security has \\ndesignated, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, as eligible to participate in the H -2A program. \\nThe list of H -2A eligible countries will be published in a notice in the FR on a rolling basis. This list was \\ninitially developed based, in part, on an identification of the top participating countries in the H -2A and H -\\n2B visa programs and their record of timely acceptance of the return of their nationals who are removed \\nfrom the United States. \\nDesignation of countries on the H -2A list of eligible countries will be valid for one year from publication. \\nThe first H -2A eligible countries list was published in the FR on December 18, 2008. See 73 FR 77043 . \\nThis list is also posted on the USCIS website. A national from a country not on the H -2A eligible country list may only be the beneficiary of an approved \\nH-2A petition if the Secretary of Homeland Security, in her sole and unreviewable discretion, determines \\nthat it is in the U.S. interest for that alien to be the beneficiary of such a petition. See AFM Chapter \\n31.4(h)(3) ; 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(i)(F)(1)(ii) . \\n(f) Petitioner Requirements . \\n(1) An H -2A petition may be filed by the employer listed on the labor certification, the employer’s agent, \\nor the association of ’’’’U.S.’’ agricultural producers named as a joint employer on the labor certification. A U.S. agent may file a petition only in cases where:',\n",
       "  '· Workers are traditionally self- employed; \\n· Workers use agents to arrange short -term employment on their behalf with numerous employers; or \\n· A foreign employer authorizes the agent to act on its behalf. \\n(2) All H -2A petitions must state the nationality of all beneficiaries . \\nSee AFM Chapter 31.4(e) . To avoid processing delays, petitioners are advised to file the petitions for \\nworkers from designated H -2A eligible countries and non- eligible countries separately . See 8 CFR \\n214.2(h)(2)(ii) . \\nAdjudicating officers will issue a request for evidence when petitions filed on behalf of a combination of \\naliens from both H -2A eligible and non- eligible countries lack sufficient evidence to establish whether the \\nbeneficiaries from non -eligible countries qualify for H -2A classification. \\n(3) Employment- related notifications . \\nThe petitioner must agree to notify USCIS within 2 work days if: \\n· a worker fails to report to work within 5 work days of the employment start date on the petition or \\nwithin 5 work days of the start date established by his or her employer, whichever is later; \\n· the agricultural labor or services for which workers were hired is completed more than 30 days earlier \\nthan the employment end date stated on the petition; or',\n",

Instructions explaining how a petitioner should make an employment -\\nrelated notification to USCIS were published in a notice in the FR on December 18, 2008. See 73 FR 77049 \\n. \\nNote: \\nUSCIS defers to the DOL’s definition of “workday” whi ch, according to the Fair Labor Standards Act, \\ngenerally means the period between the time on any particular day when an employee commences \\nhis/her \"principal activity\" and the time on that day at which he/she ceases such principal activity or \\nactivities. \\nA petitioner that fails to meet these requirements is subject to liquidated damages in the amount of $10 per \\nviolation. Failure to notify USCIS in a timely fashion may be excused at the discretion of USCIS if it is demonstrated that the delay was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the petitioner \\nand USCIS finds the delay commensurate with the circumstances. \\nSuch a determination will be made on a case -by-case basis. If the petitioner fails to demonstrate good cause \\nfor failure to make a timely notification, USCIS will notify CBP that the petitioner is liable for liquidated \\ndamages. The petitioner will then receive a demand letter for payment directly from CBP. See 8 CFR \\n214.2(h)(5)(vi)(B)(3) . \\n(4) Payment of Fees by Aliens to Obtain H -2A Employment . \\nAn H -2A petition will be denied or revoked on notice if USCIS determines that the petitioner has collected, \\nor entered into an agreement to collect a fee or compensation as a condition of obtaining the H -2A \\nemployment, or that the petitioner knows or should have known that the beneficiary has paid or agreed to \\npay any facilitator, recruiter, or similar employment service as a condition of obtaining the H -2A \\nemployment. \\nThe types of fees that would be prohibited include recruitm ent fees, attorneys’ fees, and fees for',\n",

The H Classification \\nSupplement to the Form I- 129 , revised 01- 22-2009 (p. 8 – 12 of the form) now requires a petitioner who \\nchooses to file an H -2A petition on behalf of H -2A workers who are not from a country that has been \\ndesignated as an H -2A eligible country to name those beneficiaries and provide the following information \\nabout such beneficiaries: \\n· Full Name; \\n· Date of birth; \\n· Country of birth; and \\n· Country of citizenship.',\n",
       "  'This provision applies both to beneficiaries who are currently within the United States who are seeking an \\nextension of H -2A stay or change of status to H -2A, as well as to b eneficiaries who are outside of the \\ncountry. \\nA petition filed on behalf of H -2A workers who are not from a country that has been designated as an H -2A \\neligible country may be approved only if DHS determines, in its sole and unreviewable discretion, that it is \\nin the U.S. interest for that alien to be a beneficiary of such petition. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(i)(F) . In \\norder to make this discretionary determination of U.S. interest, USCIS may take into account the following \\nfour factors, including, but not li mited to : \\nFactors: \\n1 Evidence that a worker with the required skills is not available among U.S. workers or from among \\nforeign workers from a country on the list of eligible countries; \\n2 Evidence that the beneficiary has been admitted to the United States previously in H -2A status and \\ncomplied with the terms of his/her status. \\n3 Any potential for abuse, fraud, or other harm to the integrity of the H -2A program through the \\npotential admission of these worker(s) that a petitioner plans to hire; and \\n4 Other factors that would serve the U.S. interest, if any. \\nEach request for a U.S. interest exception is fact -dependent, and therefore must be considered on a case -by-\\ncase basis. Although USCIS will consider any evidence submitted to address each factor, USCIS has determined that it is not necessary for a petitioner to satisfy each and every factor. Instead, a determination will be made based on the totality of circumstances. \\nFor factor no. 3 above, USCIS will take into consideration, among other things, whether the alien is from a \\ncountry that cooperates with the repatriation of its nationals. \\nFor factor no. 4 above, circumstances that are given weight, but are not binding, include evidence \\nsubstantiating the degree of harm that a particular U.S. employer, U.S. industry, and/or U.S. government \\nentity might suffer without the services of H -2A workers from non -eligible countries. \\nPetitions filed on behalf of beneficiaries from non -eligible countries that do not initially provide sufficient',\n",

If the alien is present in the United States and requires an extension of stay, follow \\nthe procedures described in AFM Chapter 30.2 . Notify the petitioner of the action taken using Form I -797 \\n, Notice of Action. After approval, the file containing one copy of the petition and the supporting evidence \\nshould be forwarded to the Harrisonburg File Storage Facility (HBG). \\n(2) Denial . \\nPrepare a notice of denial and advise the petitioner of the right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals \\nOffice (AAO). Retain the file, in accordance with local procedures, until the appeal period expires or an \\nappeal is received. \\nNote: \\nWhile the denial of a petition filed on behalf of a national of a country not listed on the H -2A Eligible \\nCountries List for failure to establish eligibility for the U.S. interest exception in 8 CFR\",\n",

Id. \\n(3) Partial Approv als . \\nA partial approval occurs with petitions for multiple beneficiaries when only some of the beneficiaries \\nincluded on the petition are found to be approvable and some must be denied. \\nFor example, a partial approval may result in cases where a pet ition is filed for a combination of \\nbeneficiaries from H -2A eligible and non- eligible countries and the petitioner is unable to provide \\nsufficient evidence in response to a USCIS request for evidence that the beneficiaries from non -eligible \\ncountries meet the U.S. interest requirement of 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(i)(F)(1)(ii) . \\nSince USCIS systems are not capable of counting two actions for one receipt, the action on a partial \\napproval is counted as an approval for reporting purposes. Generally, a petitioner may appeal the decision to deny classification to one or more of the beneficiaries or file a new petition in their behalf. \\n(j) Transmittal of Petitions . \\n(1) Visa Applicants . \\nIf the beneficiary requires a visa and requests consular notification, the duplicate of the approved petition (if submitted), with the supporting documents, shall be sent to the Department of State’s Kentucky Consular Center (KCC). \\n(2) Visa-exempt Applicants . \\nIf the beneficiary does not require a visa and requests notification to the port of entry or pre -flight \\ninspection facility, forward the duplicate petition (if submitted) with supporting documents to the \\nappropriate port of entry or pre -flight inspection facility.',\n",
       "  '(k) Special Handling . \\n(1) Sheepherders . \\nUntil the most recent H- 2A final rule went into effect on January 17, 2009, USCIS refrained from applying \\nthe three- year maximum period of stay for H -2A sheepherders. See 73 FR 76891 Ho wever,  effective \\nJanuary 17, 2009, sheepherders are subject to the same three -year maximum period of stay and departure \\nrequirements applicable to other H -2A workers. This change in the handling of sheepherders is mandated \\nby the statutory requirement that H-2A employment be of a temporary nature . \\n(2) Canadian Custom Harvest or Combine Operators . \\nAnnually, a group of Canadian custom harvest and combine workers come to the Midwestern United States \\nto assist U.S. farmers with harvesting wheat, corn, and other crops. Because the growing season for these crops varies depending on their specific geographical location, a definitive itinerary of services and \\nlocations is generally not provided; however, the operators typically start working in the South and work \\ntheir way through a number of states north over the course of the harvesting season. \\nAlthough petitioners filing for Canadian harvest or combine workers may not have a U.S. address, USCIS \\nhas traditionally accepted petitions filed by Canadian employers requesting these types of workers. Such \\noperators typically are coming into the United States to provide services for U.S. employers, who have \\ncontracted with a member of the Association of Canadian Harvesters. \\n(3) Certain Caribbean Residents Seek ing Admission to the United States as H -2A Agricultural Workers . \\nA visa is currently not required for H -2A workers who are British, French, or Netherlands nationals, or \\nnationals of Barbados, Grenada, Jamaica, or Trinidad and Tobago, who have their res idence in British, \\nFrench, or Netherlands territory located in the adjacent islands of the Caribbean area, or in Barbados, \\nGrenada, Jamaica, or Trinidad and Tobago.

An H -2A worker has absconded if he or she has not reported for \\nwork for a period of 5 consecutive workdays without the consent of the employer. (The worker has been \\nworking at the work -site, but abandoned his employment for a period of 5 consecutive workdays without \\nthe consent of the employer).',\n",

       "  'An individual who has held H -2A status for a total of 3 years may not again be granted H -2A status until \\nsuch time as he or she remains outside the United States for an uninterrupted period of 3 months.

As of January 18, 2009, sheepherders are no longer exempt from this 3 -year limitation of stay. See 73 FR \\n76906 . \\nNote: \\nH-2A aliens do not fall under the exception listed in 8 CFR 214.2(h)(13)(v) .

If USCIS does not approve the new petition within 120 days or denies it before 120- day period \\nexpires, USCIS will automatically terminate the H -2A alien’s employment authorization in 15 calendar \\ndays. In those cases, E -Verify will not notify the new employer that USCIS has terminated employment \\nauthorization. \\nAt its discretion, USCIS may periodically audit any new employer’s participation in E -Verify, as well as the \\nstatus of the alien’s employment on a post -adjudication basis.

This classification does not apply to graduates of medical schools \\ncoming to the United States to perform services as members of the medical profession. \\n(b) Definitions . \\n(1) Temporary Services or Labor . \\nThe term “temporary services” is defined as services where the petitioner’s need for the duties to be \\nperformed, rather than the job itself, is temporary. It is the nature of the employer's need, not the nature of the duties, that is controlling. See Matter of Artee Corporation , 18 I & N Dec. 366 (Comm. 1982) and \\nMatter of Golden Dragon Chinese Restaurant , 19 I&N Dec. 238 (Comm. 1984) and Matter of Gen eral \\nDynamics Corp. , 13 I&N Dec. 23 (Reg. Comm 1968). \\nThe nature of the employer's temporary need for H -2B employment must be seasonal, peak load, \\nintermittent, or a one -time occurrence as defined in the regulations at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(ii) . \\nEmploy ment is of a temporary nature when the employer needs a worker for a limited period of time. The \\nemployer must establish that the need for the employee will end in the near, definable future. Generally, that period of time will be limited to one year or less, but in the case of a one -time occurrence, the period \\nof employment could last longer than one year and up to three years. See 8 CFR 214.2 (h)(6)(ii)(B). \\n(2) One- Time Occurrence .\",\n",
       "  \"The petitioner must establish that the employer: \\n· Has not employed workers to perform the services or labor in the past and that it will not need workers \\nto perform the services or labor in the future, or · Has an employment situation that is otherwise permanent, but a temporary event of short duration has \\ncreated the need for a temporary worker. \\nExample: \\nA construction company is refurbishing a church and needs to bring in foreign stained glass experts, on a \\none-time basis, to complete the project. The project is estimated to last two years. \\n(3) Seasonal Need . \\nThe petitioner must establish that the services or labor is: \\n· Traditionally tied to a season of the year by an event or pattern; and \\n· Of a recurring nature. \\nThe petitioner shall specify the period(s) of time during each year in which it does not need the services or \\nlabor. \\nThe employment is not seasonal if the period during which the services or labor is not needed is \\nunpredictable or subject to change or is considered a vacation period for the petition's permanent \\nemployees.\",\n",
       "  \"Examples \\n· Dining staff at Cape Cod resorts for the summer season \\n· Ski instructors for ski resorts in the Rocky Mountains \\n· Summer lifeguards in the coastal regions \\n(4) Peak Load Need . \\nThe petitioner must establish that: \\n· The employer regularly employs permanent workers to perform the services or labor at the place of \\nemployment; \\n· The employer needs to supplement its permanent staff at the place of employment on a temporary basis \\ndue to a seasonal or short -term demand; and \\n· The temporary additions to staff will not become part of the petitioner's regular operation. \\nExample: \\nA toy manufacturing company makes a product that has suddenly surpassed all sales predictions and \\nexpectations. It may be able to demonstrate that it has a peak load need for assembly -line workers to \\nmeet its unprecedented production demands for the Christmas season. \\n(5) Intermittent Need . \\nThe petitioner must establish that it has not employed permanent or full -time workers to perform the \\nservices or labor, but occasionally or intermittently needs temporary workers to perform services or labor \\nfor short periods.\",\n",

See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D) . \\n(f) Multip le Beneficiaries . \\nMore than one beneficiary may be included in an H -2B petition as long as the total number of beneficiaries \\ndoes not exceed the number of positions certified by the DOL or Guam DOL (if applicable) on the relating \\ntemporary labor certif ication and the beneficiaries will be performing the same service, or receiving the \\nsame training, for the same period of time, and in the same location. \\n(g) Beneficiary Requirements . \\n(1)Petitions filed on behalf of beneficiaries currently in the United States requesting a change of status or \\nextension of stay in H -2B status, must identify each beneficiary and provide evidence to show that each \\nbeneficiary meets the minimum employment and job training requirements listed on the temporary labor \\ncertification (if applicable). \\n(2)Petitions filed on behalf of beneficiaries who are outside the United States requesting consular \\nnotification are not required to identify the beneficiaries or to provide evidence of each beneficiary’s \\nqualifications and/or education with the petition, since such evidence may be submitted to the consulate at \\nthe time of a visa application or to CBP at the port of entry/pre -flight inspection upon admission. \\n(3)Beneficiaries from countries not listed as eligible for H -2B classification. The H Classification',\n",
       "  'Supplement to the Form I- 129 revised 1/22/09 (p. 8 – 12 of the form) now requires a petitioner who \\nchooses to file a petition on behalf of H -2B workers who are not from a country that has been designated \\nas an H -2B eligible country to name those beneficiaries and provide the following information about such \\nbeneficiaries: \\n· Full name; \\n· Date of birth; \\n· Country of birth; and \\n· Country of citizenship. \\nThis provision applies both to beneficiaries who are currently within the United States who are seeking an \\nextension of H -2B stay or change of status to H -2B, as well as to beneficiaries who are outside of the \\ncountry. A petition filed on behalf of H -2B workers who are not from a country that has been designated as \\nan eligible country may be approved only if USCIS determines that it is in the U.S. interest for that alien to be \\na beneficiary of such petition. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(E). In order to make thi s discretionary \\ndetermination of U.S. interest, USCIS may take into account the following factors, including but not limited to : \\n· Evidence that a worker with the required skills is not available from a country on the list of eligible \\ncountries; \\n· Evidence that the beneficiary has been admitted to the United States previously in H -2B status and \\ncomplied with the terms of his/her status; · Any potential for abuse, fraud, or other harm to the integrity of the \\nH-2B program through the potential admission of these worker(s) that a petitioner plans to hire; and',\n",
       "  \"· There are other factors that would serve the U.S. interest, if any. \\nEach request for a U.S. interest exception is fact -dependent, and, therefore, must be considered on a case-\\nby-case basis. Although USCIS will consider any evidence submitted to address each factor, USCIS has \\ndetermined that it is not necessary for a petitioner to satisfy each and every factor. Instead, a determination \\nwill be made based on the totality of circumstances. \\nFor factor no. 3, USCIS will take into consideration, among other things, whether the alien is from a \\ncountry that cooperates with the repatriation of its nationals. See AFM Chapter 31.4(h)(3) . \\nFor factor no. 4, circumstances that are given weight, but are not binding, include evidence substantiating \\nthe degree of harm that a particular U.S. employer, U.S. industry, and/or U.S. government entity might suffer without the services of H -2B workers from non -eligible countries. See AFM Chap ter 31.4(h)(3) . \\nPetitions filed on behalf of beneficiaries from non -eligible countries that do not initially provide sufficient \\nevidence to overcome the requirements of 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(E)(2) will be issued a request for \\nevidence allowing 30 days to respond to USCIS. \\n(4)The approval of a permanent labor certification, or the filing of a preference petition for an alien \\ncurrently employed by the same petitioner, shall be a reason, by itself, to deny the alien's extension of stay. \\nSee 8 CFR 214.2( h)(16)(ii) . \\n(h) Decision Procedures . \\n(1) Approval . \\nIf the documentary requirements have been met and the petition is approvable, endorse the action block. \\nThe approval period should coincide with the period requested by the petitioner but should not exceed the \\nvalidity dates indicated on the temporary labor certification from the Department of Labor.\",\n",
       "  'If the alien is present in the United States and requires a change of status, follow procedures described in \\nAFM Chapter 30.3 . \\nIf the alien is present in the United States and requires an extension of stay, follow procedures described in \\nAFM Chapter 30.2 . Notify the petitioner of the action taken using Form I -797 , Notice of Action. After \\napproval, the file containing one copy of the petition and the supporting evidence should be forwarded to \\nthe Harrisonburg File Storage Facility (HBG). \\nUSCIS no longer accepts and adjudicates an H -2B petition that lacks an approved temporary labor \\ncertification from the Department of Labor or Guam Department of Labor. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(iv)(A) \\nand (v)(A) . Any such petition will be rejected and returned to the petitioner, together with any fee \\nsubmitted with the petition. As in the case of other rejected petitions, there is no appeal from the rejection \\nof an H -2B petition lacking an approved temporary labor certification. Appeals of the denied temporary \\nlabor certifications must be adjudicated by the Department of Labor’s appellate authority the Bureau of \\nAlien Labor Certification Appeals (BALCA). See 20 CFR 655.11 . \\n(2) Denial . \\nPrepare a notice of denial and advise the petitioner of the right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals \\nOffice (AAO). Retain the file, in accordance with local procedures, until the appeal period expires or an \\nappeal is received. \\nNote: \\nWhile the denial of a petition filed on behalf of a national of a country not listed on the H -2B Eligible \\nCountries List for failure to establish eligibility for the U.S. interest exception in 8 CFR \\n214.2(h)(6)(i)(E)(2) may be appealed to the AAO, there is no judicial appeal available to challenge such \\na discretionary denial, as such decisions, by regulation, are, as noted above, made in the Secretary’s sole and unreviewable discretion. Id. \\n(3) Partial Approvals . \\nA partial approval can occur with petitions for multiple beneficiaries when only some of the beneficiaries \\nincluded on the petition are found to be approvable and some must be denied. For example, a partial',\n",
       "  'approval may result in cases where a petition is filed for a combination of beneficiaries from H -2B eligible \\nand non -eligible countries and the petitioner is unable to provide sufficient evidence in response to a USCIS \\nrequest for evidence that the beneficiaries from non -eligible countries meet the U.S. interest requirements \\nof 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(E)(2) . \\nSince USCIS systems are not capable of counting two actions for one receipt, the action on a partial \\napproval is counted as an approval for reporting purposes. A petitioner may appeal the decision to deny \\nclassification to one or more of the beneficiaries or file a new petition in their behalf. \\n(i) Transmittal of Petition . \\n(1) Visa Applicants . \\nIf the beneficiary requires a visa and requests consular notification, the duplicate of the approved petition \\n(if submitted), with the supporting documents, shall be sent to the Department of State’s Kentucky Consular Center (KCC). \\n(2) Visa-exempt Applicants . \\nWhen the beneficiary does not require a visa, the duplicate petition (if submitted), without supporting \\ndocuments, shall be forwarded to the appropriate port of entry or pre -flight inspection facility. \\n(j) Special Handling Situations . \\n(1) Boilermakers . \\nThe National Association of Construction Boilermaker Employers and the International Brotherhood of \\nBoilermakers have made arrangements with the Department of Labor and USCIS to obtain expedited',\n",
       "  \"determinations on H -2B temporary labor certification applications and petitions for boilermakers from the \\nCanadian boilermaker's union when there are insufficient U.S. boilermakers to meet contract needs. \\n(A) Filing Procedures . \\nThe Manpower Optimization Stabilization and Training Fund (MOST ) in Kansas City, Kansas serves as the \\nclearinghouse for the employers and workers and will submit all of the paperwork required for temporary \\nlabor certification and petition approval. MOST will not be the petitioner or sign forms for the employers. \\nPetitions for Canadian boilermakers who are outside of the United States may be filed with the service \\ncenter without the names and evidence of qualifications of beneficiaries. Service center directors shall \\nexpedite adjudication of such petitions under emergent procedures. A separate temporary labor certification and petition must be filed for each employer. When the workers for an employer will enter at different ports of entry, a separate petition with a copy of the same temporary labor certification mus t be filed for \\neach port of entry. \\n(B) Handling of Approved Petitions . \\nOn approval, the director shall send the petition to the designated port of entry. MOST will provide the port \\nof entry the names and evidence of the qualifications of beneficiaries before they apply for admission. The port director shall be responsible for nonimmigrant control. When an approved petition involves replacement, MOST will provide the port with the names of beneficiaries to be replaced, the date they \\ndeparted the United States, and the names and evidence of the qualifications of new beneficiarie s who will \\napply for admission. \\n(2) Fish Roe Workers . \\nThe numerical limitation in section 214(g)(1)(B) of the Act does not apply to any nonimmigrant alien \\nissued an H -2B visa or otherwise provided H -2B status who is employed or has received an offer of \\nemployment as a fish roe processor, a fish roe technician, or a supervisor of fish roe processing.

       "  '(3) Workers performing labor and services in Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \\nIslands (CNMI) . \\nThe Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 (CNRA), Public Law 110- 229 , includes a provision \\nexempting H -2B workers performing labor or services in Guam and the CNMI from the H -2B numerical \\nlimitation in section 214(g)(1)(B) of the INA (aka the “H -2B cap”). Upon the CNRA’s implementation on \\nNovember 28, 2009, H -2B workers in Guam and the CNMI are exempt from the statutory numerical \\nlimitation for H -2B classification from November 28, 2009 to December 31, 2014. See section 6(b) of \\nPublic Law 94 -241, as added by section 702 of the CNRA. \\nThis H -2B cap exemption does not apply to any employment to be performed outside of the CNMI or \\nGuam. As such, to qualify for this exemption, the petition must include an approved temporary labor \\ncertification for work locations in the CNMI and/or Guam onl y. \\nAn H -2B worker granted H -2B status under this CNMI/Guam cap exemption who ceases to be employed in \\nH-2B classification solely in the CNMI and/or Guam shall be deemed subject to the H -2B cap. A subsequent \\npetition filed for such an H -2B worker (i.e. a change of employer petition with a request for an extension \\nof stay) requesting employment located outside of CNMI and/or Guam is subject to the H -2B cap. \\n(k) Adjudicative Issues . \\n(1) Determining the Petitioner’s Ability to Pay the Required Wage . \\nThis issue is most commonly associated with small enterprises that do not necessarily have the assets \\nrequired to pay the salary guaranteed in the petition. Such a petition may be an accommodation to a \\nrelative or friend who will seek other employment or there may be an agreement to work for lower wages. \\nIt is not necessary that complete financial data be submitted with every petition. However, if the financial \\ncondition of the petitioner calls into question whether the petitioner really intends to employ the alien as \\nclaimed, evidence of financial ability may be requested at the discretion of the adjudicating officer in order to determine whether there exists a bona fide job offer.',\n",
       "  \"Other factors that may be examined include, but are not limited to, the nature of the petitioner's business, \\nthe relationship between the beneficiary and the owners/officers of the petitioning entity, and the petitioner and beneficiary's immigration histories. \\n(2) Need for Workers . \\nAs it is within USCIS scope to evaluate whether there is an actual need for the work itself and whether there \\nis a genuine job offer, adjudications officers are advised to evaluate an H -2B petitioner’s actual need for the \\nnumber of employees requested and to issue an RFE in cases where there is doubt as to the need for the \\nnumber of H -2B workers requested. \\n(3) Substitution of Beneficiaries . \\nH-2B workers that have not yet been admitted to the United States may be substituted as long as the \\nemployer can demonstrate that the total number of beneficiaries will not exceed the number of \\nbeneficiaries certified in the original temporary labor certification. \\n(A)Substitution of beneficiaries with aliens who are outside of the United States are processed directly with \\nthe consular office at which each alien will apply for a visa or, if the alien is visa exempt, at the port of \\nentry or pre -flight inspection location where the alien will apply for admission. \\n(B)Substitution of beneficiaries with aliens who are currently in the United States is processed by USCIS. \\nThe petitioner must file an amended petition at the Service Center where the original petition was filed. The \\namended petition must retain a period of employment within the same half of the same fiscal year as the \\noriginal petition and include: \\n· A filing fee; \\n· A copy of the original petition approval notice;\",\n",
       "  '· A copy of the temporary labor certification; \\n· A statement explaining why the substitution is necessary; \\n· Evidence of the qualifications of each beneficiary, if applicable; \\n· Evidence of the beneficiaries’ current status in the ’’’’United States’’; and \\n· Evidence that the total number of beneficiaries will not exceed the number of H -2B workers authorized \\non the labor certification. \\nH-2B workers who were already admitted to the United States may not be substituted.

An E-1 alien may perform servi ces for the parent treaty organization or any of its subsidiaries. \\n(3) Nationality . \\nThe principal employer must be either a person in the U.S. having the nationality of the treaty country (or, \\nif not in the U.S., otherwise entitled to treaty trader status) or an enterprise at least 50% owned by persons \\nin the U.S. of such nationality. The list of treaty countries is contained in the Department of State’s Foreign \\nAffairs Manual , chapter 41.51, Exhibit 1 . The nationality list for treaty traders is different than the list for \\ntreaty investors. \\nNote 1: \\nThe nationality of the spouse or child of a treaty trader is irrelevant to their classification.

[Section (b) amended 10/6/2010; AD10- 48; PM -602- 0009] \\n(a) Current Law . \\nThe present nonimmigrant temporary worker categories have changed significantly, becoming more \\nrestrictive in some ways and more generous in others, in several stages since 1986. Current law provides for the admission of several specific categories of temporary workers (H nonimmigrant categories, as well \\nas L, O and P categories discussed in other chapters of this manual): \\n·  H-1B classification, created by Public Law 101- 238 (1989) (and the Immigration Nursing Relief Act \\nwhich also created the now defunct H1 -A nurse classification) and modified by Public Law 101 -649 \\n(1990) is reserved for aliens employed in “specialty occupations”, defined as in section 214(i) and for \\nfashion models of “distinguished merit and ability”; \\n·  H-1C classification, created by Public Law 106- 95 (1999), is reserved for registered nurses employed \\nin specifically designated nursing shortage areas; ·  H-2A classification, created by Public Law 99 -603 (1986), is reserved for temporary or seasonal \\nagricultural workers; \\n·  H-2B classification, created by Public Law 99 -603 (1986), is reserved for other temporary workers; \\n·  H-3 classification is reserved for “industrial trainees” who will not primarily be engaged in productive',\n",

       "  'The Immigration Act of 1952 established a new nonimmigrant class of temporary workers. In these \\nprovisions, Congress sought to grant the Attorney General sufficient authority to admit temporarily certain \\nalien workers, industrial, agricultural, or otherwise, for the purpose of alleviating labor shortages as they exist or may develop in cert ain areas or certain branches of American productive enterprises, particularly in \\nperiods of intensified production. The provisions also enabled foreign trainees to acqui re the knowledge of \\nAmerican industrial, agricultural, and business methods. In 1970, Congress eliminated the requirement that \\nan alien of distinguished merit and ability must be coming to a temporary position. However, both the petitioner and the beneficiary must intend that the employment be for a temporary period of time. Also, in \\nthat year Congress added another new immigrant category, the L -1, intracompany transferee. \\nPrior to 1989, there were three H nonimmigrant worker classifications. The H -1 category included all \\n“persons of distinguished merit and ability” which was generously interpreted to include all persons',\n",
       "  'that year Congress added another new immigrant category, the L -1, intracompany transferee. \\nPrior to 1989, there were three H nonimmigrant worker classifications. The H -1 category included all \\n“persons of distinguished merit and ability” which was generously interpreted to include all persons \\nengaged in occupations which required a bachelor’s degree or equivalent. Also included were registered nurses, athletes, artists and entertainers. There was no maximum time limit on the total period of stay or \\nnumber of extensions which could be approved for an H -1, although in practice an H -1 requesting an e \\nxtension beyond five years was generally denied as an “intending immigrant.” There was no limit on the \\nnumber of H -1 aliens who could be admitted to the United States on an annual basis, nor was there any \\nlabor market test required. Among the professions, only medical doctors, other than those entering to perform teaching or research, were precluded from the H -1 classification. \\nIn 1986, Pub. L 99 -603 created a separate H -2A category for temporary/seasonal agricultural workers. \\nOther temporary workers were redesignated as H- 2B. \\nIn 1989, Pub. L. 101- 238 created a separate category (H -1A) for registered nurses. This Act also \\nredesignated the existing H -1 category as H1-B. The H -1A category was permitted to sunset on September \\n1, 1995, with some nurses granted extensions in the category through September 30, 1997. On November',\n",

L 101-649, and the definition of H -1B \\nchanged from an alien of “distinguished merit and ability” to one coming to perform “services in a \\nspecialty occupation.” In addition, numerical limitations on new admissions of H -1B, H -2A and H -2B \\nnonimmigrants were imposed for the first time. Further, the new law imposed a “labor condition \\napplication” p rovision that required the employer to pay any H -1B worker the higher of the actual or \\nprevailing wage for the occupation in the local area of employment.

The term was created by the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), although its \\ndefinition was taken from prior case law which related to “professional” occupations which qualified for \\npre-IMMACT H -1 status. An alien may qualify for a specialty occupation by virtue of formal education, \\nexperience, or a combination of both. However, do not rely on pre -IMMACT precedent case law for \\nguidance on specialt y occupations.

However, it is important to note that occupations are rapidly evolving an d job titles \\nthemselves are often meaningless.

It is important not to be so influenced by a single factor, such as the job title or salary, that other indicators are overlooked.

Adjudicators should be thoroughly \\nfamiliar with 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(D) which describes the kind and amount of experience which can be \\nused to establish the equivalence of a degree. Three years of professional experience may be used to substitute for each year of college -level training. The most critical aspect of this type of adjudication is \\ndeciding whether the quality of experience is at high enough level to qualify as “professional.” Experience \\nis generally documented through letters from past employers and may be so lacking in specific ity as to \\nmake the qualitative determination difficult or impossible. The regulations for deciding equivalency are \\nvery specific and must be closely followed.',\n",

The regulations for deciding equivalency are \\nvery specific and must be closely followed.  \\n \\n \\nForeign educational credentials, licenses and other forms of documentation are easier to evaluate than \\nexperience. The petitioner may establish from an authoritative source or from transcripts, certificates, or \\nother such school records that the alien has college -level education. College -level training may have been',\n",
       "  'acquired at a college or univers ity or other academic institution which grants a degree, diploma, or \\ncertificate, such as a technical college. It may be useful to compare the beneficiary’s age a t completion and \\nthe duration of the course of study, with the average age of graduates of United States institutions offering \\nsimilar programs as a factor in determining equivalency of education.  \\n \\n \\nSpecialized training may have been acquired through an apprenticeship program, employee -sponsored \\ntraining courses, vocational training schools, or other commercial training facilities. The starting and \\nending dates of all training in the field must be shown. Training certificates and an outline or summary of \\nthe curriculum should be submitted.  \\n \\n \\nMembership in a professional association, per se , is insufficient evidence of equivalency. An association \\nwhich grants certification or registration in the profession should have an accrediting body which has standards for the profession, and which issues an official document to applicants verifying that they  have \\nbeen awarded professional credentials in the profession. The standards of the organization should be \\nreviewed to ensure that bachelor’s degree or higher, or its equivalent, is required for membership.  \\n \\n \\nIn suspect cases, overseas experience can be v erified by the overseas DHS office (see Chapter 10.5(d) on \\nrequesting an overseas investigation) .

USCIS does not require the alien to be enrolled in a program for college credit at the \\nuniversity in order to accept the evaluation of such an expert. However, the official must be formally \\ninvolved with the college or university's official  program for granting credit based on training and/ or \\nexperience to have the required authority and expertise to make such evaluations.

       "  'There are a number of outside organizations which evaluate educational credentials to determine degree \\nequivalency. Some organizations may also provide an opinion on the equivalency of experience to educat ion. It is important that the adjudicator distinguish between these two types of evaluations. The latter \\ntype of evaluation carries little weight . Although USCIS does not specifically recognize or accredit any sources of evaluations, foreign educational degree evaluations can be of assistance if they are thorough, well documented and specific in reaching an equivalency determination.  \\n \\n \\n(4) Assessing the Needs of the Petitioner for the Services of the Beneficiary .  \\n \\n \\nThis issue is occasionally present in H-1B petitions filed by small businesses for aliens with professional \\nskills not normally associated with persons employed in such a business (e.g., a petition for an accountant \\nfiled by an auto repair business or restaurant).

It can also apply to a longer cycle. \\n(2) Temporary . \\nExcept in extraordinary circumstances, temporary agricultural employment does not last longer than one \\nyear. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(iv)(A) . Ordinarily, the certification by the Department of Labor (DOL) is \\nsufficient evidence that the employment is tempora ry. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(iv)(B) .

See Memorandum: Updated Procedures for H -2A (Agricultural Worker \\nI-129 Petitions (Oct. 19, 2007), Appendix 31- 2 . In accordance with the October 19, 2007 memo, USCIS \\nprovides special handling of H -2A petitions in which: \\n· Personnel in the Service Center mail room are instructed to generate fee receipts, enter data, and route \\nH-2A petitions for immediate distribution; \\n·  H-2A petitions are distributed to adjudication officers no later than the third day after receipt; \\n· Adjudications officers are reminded to adjudicate unnamed beneficiaries’ H -2A petitions on the day the \\ncases are assigned to them; and \\n· Once an H -2A approval notice is generated and printed, it should be sent to petitioners within 24 \\nhours of the decision. \\n(d) Labor Certification . \\nAn H -2A petition must be filed on Form I- 129 with a single valid temporary agricultural labor certification. \\nSee 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(i)(A) .
